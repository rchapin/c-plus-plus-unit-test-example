Go through and modify and pointers that are created, that aren't dynamically allocted, and in the context can never be null, to references.

For instance, the blocking_queue, mutex and conditional_var cannot ever be null for these classes, so the members should probably be updated to be references instead of pointers.  Also, I don't think that I am doing any pointer arithmetic with them, so all the more reason to be references.

Refactor the cpp-unit-test-example.cpp so that it is unit-testable:
	. eliminate the global producer and consumer arrays and refactor so
that those dependencies can be properly mocked.
