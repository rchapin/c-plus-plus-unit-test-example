c-plus-plus-unit-test-example
=============================

A working example of a c++ project with unit tests and mock objects.

The example is a multi-threaded producer/consumer example.  Once compiled it can be run simply by invoking

```
./bin/cpp-unit-test-example
```
Ctrl-C will gracefully shutdown the program as it listens for and shutsdown on SIGINT signals.
